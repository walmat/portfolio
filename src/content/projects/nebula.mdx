As I was transitioning out of University in May of 2018, I had a diminishing desire to work for someone else and build out their vision for what would "make the world a better place." This realization led me on a journey of thinking and reflecting on what I felt passionate about and felt could be a viable source of income to pay off my student loans as quickly as possible.

Enter Nebula: An automation application I built to help secure the most sought-after sneakers and high-end fashion. I had been using it for a few months and had been able to secure a few pairs of sneakers and a few pieces of clothing. I quickly realized that I could sell this as licensed software to others who want to either secure a pair of sneakers or make a quick buck by flipping them like I was. I decided to take the plunge and launch Nebula as a product in the summer of 2018, with version one being called Nebula Orion. Fast forwarding to 2019, during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Nebula was being used by thousands of people, and I was pulling **$175,000 MRR**, which allowed me to pay off my student loans in less than a year of graduation. The final version of Nebula was called Nebula Carina, a web application written in React.js with a backend in Golang. It had a bundle size of less than 30 MB and allowed users virtually unlimited tasks due to the Golang engine. Nebula Carina launched in January 2021. We had thousands of DAUs worldwide trying to secure anything from PS5s, hats, sneakers, clothing, etc.

I exited the company by stepping down and transitioning into automating NFTs in the early spring of 2021.
