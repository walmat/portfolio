As I graduated from university in May 2018, I had little desire to work for someone else and build out their vision for what would "make the world a better place." This led me to reflect on what I was passionate about and what could realistically pay off my student loans as quickly as possible.

Enter Nebula: an automation application I built to help secure the most sought-after sneakers and high-end fashion. After using it personally for a few months and successfully securing several pairs, I realized I could license the software to others who wanted to do the same—whether to cop a pair for themselves or flip them for profit. I launched Nebula as a product in the summer of 2018, with the first version called Nebula Orion.

By 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Nebula had grown to thousands of users and was generating **$175,000 MRR**. This allowed me to pay off my student loans in less than a year after graduation. The final version, Nebula Carina, launched in January 2021 as a web application built with React.js and a Golang backend. The bundle size was under 30 MB, and the Golang engine enabled users to run virtually unlimited concurrent tasks. At its peak, we had thousands of daily active users worldwide trying to secure everything from PS5s to sneakers to limited-edition clothing.

I stepped down from Nebula in early spring 2021 to explore opportunities in the NFT space.
