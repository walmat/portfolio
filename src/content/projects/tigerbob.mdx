After exiting Nebula, I took a break from building software to focus on my health and fitness. Three years of intense work had left me burnt out and in need of a reset.

In early spring 2021, I re-entered the tech world through NFTs, writing automation software to mint tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. I quickly gained a following on Twitter, which caught the attention of Gossamer. I had been following their work for a while and admired their creative vision, so when they reached out about collaborating on the Tigerbob brand, I jumped at the opportunity. We launched Tigerbob together in the summer of 2021.

Tigerbob was backed by an ERC721A smart contract with a total supply of 1,000 NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. Each token was priced at 0.25 ETH and sold out during the public sale. Secondary market prices quickly climbed to over 2 ETH per token.

While building Tigerbob, I took on several contract projects ranging from full 10,000-piece PFP collections to NFT appraisal tools. This work caught the attention of RECUR, an early-stage Web3 startup. I decided to step back from Tigerbob to join RECUR full-time as a Senior Frontend Engineer, while continuing to build a Web3 game on the Arbitrum Nova blockchain on the side.
