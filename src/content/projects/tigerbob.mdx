Shortly after exiting Nebula, I decided to take a break from building out software and focus on my health and fitness. I had been working on Nebula for over three years, and I was burnt out. I needed a break. I decided to enter into the NFT community early spring of 2021 by writing an automation software that would allow me to mint NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain and flip them for a profit. I quickly gained a following on Twitter and it was at that time that Gossamer reached out to me to help build out the Tigerbob brand. I was excited to work with Gossamer as I had been following their work for a while and was a fan of the vision they had for their brand. We decided to build out the Tigerbob brand together and launch it in the summer of 2021.

Tigerbob was backed by an ERC721A smart contract with a total supply of one thousand. The NFTs were minted on the Ethereum blockchain and were sold for 0.25Ξ each. The NFTs sold out in the public sale and were trading on secondary markets for over 2Ξ each. The Tigerbob brand is still in its infancy, but there are big plans to expand the brand and build out the community.

While working on Tigerbob, I was contracted to do a number of NFT projects which ranged from full-fledged 10,000 profile picture collections, to NFT appraisal tools. Because of this, I caught the attention of an early stage Web3 startup: RECUR. I decided to take a step back from Tigerbob and work full-time as a Senior Frontend Engineer there while also building out a coveted Web3 crypto game on the Arbitrum Nova blockchain.
