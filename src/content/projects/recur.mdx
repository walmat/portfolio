Working at RECUR was one of the most rewarding periods of my career. Being surrounded by people who challenge you is how you grow—both as a developer and as a person. As a Senior Frontend Engineer, I owned the frontend for RECUR Studio, their proprietary NFT creation platform.

RECUR Studio is a full-stack application built with Remix and React.js, using Prisma as the ORM with PostgreSQL for persistence. The application runs on a Kubernetes cluster hosted on AWS.

The platform enables anyone to create an NFT website, generate artwork, and deploy to the Polygon blockchain. Thanks to RECUR's chain-agnostic architecture, end users can pay with fiat, crypto, or their existing wallet balance—lowering the barrier to entry for mainstream adoption.

We operated in two-week agile sprints using JIRA for ticketing, Confluence for documentation, and Slack for communication. I worked closely with the Platform team to ensure scalability and performance, and partnered with Product Designers to create an intuitive user experience. The platform partnered with major brands including Nickelodeon, Hello Kitty, and Paramount to bring beloved IP on-chain.
