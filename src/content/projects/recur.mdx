Working at RECUR was one of the most rewarding times of my life. Being surrounded by people who challenge you is how you best grow as a developer and more importantly, a human being. As a Senior Frontend Engineer, I was responsible for their proprietary platform called RECUR Studio. RECUR Studio is a full-stack application that utilizes Remix, React.js, and a Prisma draft layer, as well as a PostgreSQL persistence layer. The application is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster and is hosted on AWS.

RECUR Studio enables anyone to quickly create an NFT website and any related artwork, and then deploy it to the Polygon blockchain. Utilizing their chain-agnostic approach, your end-user(s) can choose to pay in fiat, crypto, or even their previous wallet balance.

The team operated in two week agile sprints with a JIRA ticket-based approach. We also used Confluence for internal documentation, and Slack for internal communication. I was responsible for the frontend of the application, and I worked closely with the Platform team to ensure that the application was scalable and performant. I also worked closely with the Product Designers to ensure that the application was intuitive and easy to use. RECUR Studio is still in its early stages, but there are big plans to expand the platform and ultimately launch the platform in 2023 for anyone to use.
